Troubleshooting
===============

Fix the following error:

    alsamixer
    cannot open mixer: No such file or directory

with:

    alsactl init # Maybe run as root

run: alsaconf
then reboot computer
or else you need to unload and load modules and who knows what
so just reboot

# Remember volume

sudo alsactl store
