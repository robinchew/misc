Troubleshooting
===============

If the following error occurs:

    alsamixer
    cannot open mixer: No such file or directory

There are a few possible solutions, try:

    alsactl init # Maybe run as root

If that doesn't work, then check:

    cat /proc/asound/modules

Which normally shows something like:

    0 snd_hda_intel
    1 snd_hda_intel

If instead, it shows:

    1 snd_hda_intel
    2 snd_hda_intel

Then that could be the defining problem and the solution
can be to disable any unused sound cards in the BIOS, until
0 index shows again.

run: alsaconf
then reboot computer
or else you need to unload and load modules and who knows what
so just reboot

# Remember volume

sudo alsactl store
