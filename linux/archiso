# IMPORTANT!!! 
# if 'make' has been executed and you changed the package list after,
# you have to delete work/iso and work/root-image also
# remember to backup downloaded packages so don't have to download again
# then make again

# include following EXTRA packages
vim
ttf-ms-fonts
python2
gparted
xorg

# make sure the indentation of Makefile are TABS.

$ cp -R /root/archiso-git/src/archiso/configs/syslinux-iso /root/
$ cd /root/syslinux-iso
$ make core-iso

# the process of 'make' is to download and install packages into work/root-image/
# then later squashed into squashfs format for use as installation medium

# BACKUP PACKAGE
# notes below is NOT using base profile
# when running 'make all' or 'make core-iso'
# /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ on this machine is mounted on work/root-image/var/cache/pacman/pkg/ ???
# 'make' download packages to work/core-pkgs/src/core/pkg/

# If any problem with make, just delete everything in work/
# BUT make sure all packages downloaded in work/core-pkg/src/core/pkg/ is backed up and copied to /var/cache/pacman/pkg/,
# then make again,
# maybe pacman -Syu


# you can get out of chroot at this point
