 Sorry, configure.pl does not support automatic add to cron yet.
 You can do it manually by adding the following command to your cron:
 /usr/local/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/awstats.pl -update -config=gandaauto.com
 Or if you have several config files and prefer having only one command:
 /usr/local/awstats/tools/awstats_updateall.pl now
 Press ENTER to continue... 


 A SIMPLE config file has been created: /etc/awstats/awstats.gandaauto.com.conf
 You should have a look inside to check and change manually main parameters.
 You can then manually update your statistics for 'gandaauto.com' with command:
 > perl awstats.pl -update -config=gandaauto.com
 You can also read your statistics for 'gandaauto.com' with URL:
 > http://localhost/awstats/awstats.pl?config=gandaauto.com

 Press ENTER to finish...
