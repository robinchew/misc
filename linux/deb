=================

# edit source

Build Dependencies & Package (Doesn't Work)
-------------------------------------------

https://wiki.debian.org/BuildingAPackage

According to wiki above, you must do the following (devscripts contains mk-build-deps)::

    apt-get install devscripts
    mk-build-deps -i -r fdupes

Then build package with following while in nginx-1.2.1 folder::

    fakeroot debian/rules binary

But it doesn't work, because Debian's documentation sucks.

Build Dependencies & Package (Works)
------------------------------------

https://sjp.co.nz/posts/building-nginx-for-debian-systems/

Build dependencies with::

    apt-get build-dep nginx

    # perhaps mk-build-deps can be tried again,
    # in case it doesn't at this stage or
    # package building stage

Build package while in nginx-1.2.1 folder::

    dpkg-buildpackage
