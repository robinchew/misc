# Determine nameservers
nslookup robin.com.au
# Or
dig NS obsi.com.au
# NOTE!
# You cannot get a list of nameservers for subdomains
# because NS is setup only for the root domain.
dig NS lightcube.obsi.com.au # <- WRONG

# Determine TTL
dig robin.com.au

# Sometimes the following doesn't work:

dig overwrite.com.au

So you have to do the following instead, for some reason:

dig +noadflag overwrite.com.au
