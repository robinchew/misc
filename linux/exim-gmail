OR

copy the 2 files from the linux/exim4 folder into /etc/exim4/
tested for Ubuntu Hardy

Uncomment (don't copy and paste from here because my copy from file cut out end of lines) the following lines:
# plain_server:
#   driver = plaintext
#   public_name = PLAIN
#   server_condition = "${if crypteq{$3}{${extract{1}{:}{${lookup{$2}lsearch{CON$
#   server_set_id = $2
#   server_prompts = :
#   .ifndef AUTH_SERVER_ALLOW_NOTLS_PASSWORDS
#   server_advertise_condition = ${if eq{$tls_cipher}{}{}{*}}
#   .endif

Once that has been done create (or edit if it exists) /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros

Add the line:
MAIN_TLS_ENABLE = true

To actually setup the users and passwords create /etc/exim4/passwd

Copy output from:
htpasswd -nd usernameforsmtp

And paste it in /etc/exim4/passwd

Repeat for any other logins you'd like to add.

# update-exim4.conf
# /etc/init.d/exim4 restart
