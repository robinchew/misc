#
# iw = input width
# -1 = automatically resize
# Below scale argument is saying: Make the width smaller at 75% and automatically resize the height

ffmpeg -i input.mp4  -vf scale=iw/1.35:-1 output.mp4

# Scaling AVI by outputting to MP4
# For some reason converting AVI to smaller AVI will result with file size 10 times smaller but with bad pixelated quality.
# That's why outputting to MP4 gives a better result.

ffmpeg -i input.avi  -vf scale=-1:720 output.mp4
