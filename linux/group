# normally you need to logout for group assignment to take effect
# alternatively, you can run the following in a terminal for the effect to take place immediately
# but the effect is only within that terminal only 
newgrp audio

#new file created will have group write permission
umask 002

#try:

#instead of reboot
#to have changes in effect in /etc/profile
