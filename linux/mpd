MPD and PulseAudio
==================

mpd and pulseaudio will have more success of working if
they are both run as a local user. So create service files
in /usr/lib/systemd/user/ instead of /usr/lib/systemd/system.

Disable system's and user's mpd with::

    sudo systemctl stop mpd
    sudo systemctl disable mpd

    systemctl --user stop mpd
    systemctl --user disable mpd

Enable local user's mpd with::

    systemctl --user start mpd-custom
    systemctl --user enable mpd-custom

mpd.service
===========

Find mpd.service file in this folder, and put in /usr/lib/systemd/user/,
and rename to mpd-custom.service because mpd.service already exists.
See difference between system's and user's service files below.

/usr/lib/systemd/system/mpd.service::

    [Service]
    User=mpd
    Type=notify
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon

/usr/lib/systemd/user/mpd-custom.service::

    [Service]
    Type=notify
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon /home/robin/mpd.conf

mpd.conf
========

echo > /home/robin/mpd.conf << EOF
pid_file "/home/robin/mpd.pid"
db_file "/var/lib/mpd/mpd.db"
state_file "/var/lib/mpd/mpdstate"
playlist_directory "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
music_directory "/var/lib/mpd/music"
mixer_type "software"

audio_output {
    type "pulse"
    name "Pulseaudio"
}
EOF

Permissions
===========
Assuming systemd service file defaults to 'mpd' user

    chown -R mpd /run/mpd/mpd.pid
    chown -R mpd /var/lib/mpd/

However /var/lib/mpd/playlists folder needs 'robin' permission so that m3u file can save or delete because cantata is launched by 'robin'.

    chown robin /var/lib/mpd/playlists

Troubleshoot
============

MPD output:

    Jan 01 18:56:49 silverstone mpd[17491]: exception: Failed to open "Pulseaudio" (pulse); failed to connect: Connection refused

Fix with stopping all mpd services and starting mpd-custom as a user using systemd as described below.

After Arch Linux upgrade, disable default systemd services::

    sudo systemctl stop mpd
    sudo systemctl disable mpd
    systemctl --user stop mpd
    systemctl --user disable mpd

Then start the custom mpd-custom.service which should have been created following the above instructions::

    systemctl --user start mpd-custom
    systemctl --user enable mpd-custom

Run mpd without systemd complicating things. Usually it's permission problems.

    /usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon --stderr --verbose ~/mpd.conf

Once mpd works, get mpd systemd service working by adding:

    [Service]
    Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
