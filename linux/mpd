MPD and PulseAudio
==================

mpd and pulseaudio will have more success of working if
they are both run as a local user. So create service files
in /usr/lib/systemd/user/ instead of /usr/lib/systemd/system.

Disable system's mpd with::

    sudo systemctl stop mpd
    sudo systemctl disable mpd

Enable local user's mpd with::

    systemctl --user start mpd
    systemctl --user enable mpd

mpd.service
===========

Find mpd.service file in this folder, and put in /usr/lib/systemd/user/.
See difference between system's and user's service files below.

/usr/lib/systemd/system/mpd.service::

    [Service]
    User=mpd
    Type=notify
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon

/usr/lib/systemd/user/mpd.service::

    [Service]
    Type=notify
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon /home/robin/mpd.conf

mpd.conf
========

echo > /home/robin/mpd.conf << EOF
pid_file "/home/robin/mpd.pid"
db_file "/var/lib/mpd/mpd.db"
state_file "/var/lib/mpd/mpdstate"
playlist_directory "/var/lib/mpd/playlists"
music_directory "/var/lib/mpd/music"
mixer_type "software"

audio_output {
    type "pulse"
    name "Pulseaudio"
}
EOF

Permissions
===========
Assuming systemd service file defaults to 'mpd' user

    chown -R mpd /run/mpd/mpd.pid
    chown -R mpd /var/lib/mpd/

However /var/lib/mpd/playlists folder needs 'robin' permission so that m3u file can save or delete because cantata is launched by 'robin'.

    chown robin /var/lib/mpd/playlists

Troubleshoot
============

Run mpd without systemd complicating things. Usually it's permission problems.

    /usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon --stderr --verbose ~/mpd.conf

Once mpd works, get mpd systemd service working by adding:

    [Service]
    Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000
