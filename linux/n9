If the N9's power button is broken and battery is drained, you have to boot via USB and commandline.

Run the following, -R stands for reboot:

    flasher -R

You will see:

    Suitable USB interface (bootloader/phonet) not found, waiting...

Now plug in the USB, and the effect should be immediate with the N9 begining to boot.

If nothing happens
------------------

Then try another USB port. Perhaps it needs to be a USB 2.0 port. The USB port in front of allendale with the Cooler Master case is known to not work.
