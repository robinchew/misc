Install
=======

pacman -S nvidia


Black Screen / Blank Screen
===========================

This can happen after installing nvidia and rebooting. This could be caused by conflicting graphics driver, so you need to remove them: 

    sudo pacman -Rs mesa mesa-dri nouveau

The command above is just an example of a few competing packages that needs to be removed, there are definitely others.

You should blacklist the intel kernel module also:

    echo 'blacklist i915' > /etc/modprobe.d/no-intel.conf
