warning: Public keyring not found; have you run 'pacman-key --init'?
error: linux: key "771DF6627EDF681F" is unknown

sudo pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate archlinux

init can take forever if you do it through SSH or Virtualmachine because it needs mouse movement to create entropy,
so:

    pacman -S haveged
    haveged -w 1024
    pacman-key --init
    pkill haveged
    pacman -Rs haveged
