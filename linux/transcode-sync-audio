transcode -i test.avi -o toast.avi -D 0 -P 1 -N 0x55

-D start from frame number

-P flag 
pass-through flag (0=off|1=V|2=A|3=A+V) [0]. 
Pass-through for flag != 1 is broken and not a trivial thing to fix. 
You can pass-through DV video, AVI files and MPEG2 video. When doing MPEG2 pass-through (together with the -y raw module), you can give a requantization factor by using -w -- for example -w 1.5 -- this will make the MPEG2 stream smaller. 
The pass-through mode is useful for reconstruction of a broken index of an AVI file. The -x ffmpeg import-module analyzes the compressed bitstream and can detect a keyframe for DIV3, MPEG4 (DivX, XviD, ..) and other formats. It then sets an internal flag which the export module will respect when writing the frame out.

-N 0xNN 
export audio format id [0x55]. 
Available format IDs are: 
0x1 
PCM uncompressed audio 
0x50 
MPEG layer-2 aka MP2 
0x55 
MPEG layer-3 aka MP3. Also have a look at --lame_preset if you intend to do VBR audio. 
0x2000 
AC3 audio 
0xfffe 
OGG/Vorbis audio
